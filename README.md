STM32F407_STM32CubeMX_tutorial

All is my STM32F407 Project Created on Keil uVision 5 with generated code from STM32CubeMX.

In Project using MPU-9250 I2C on 400kHz (fast mode), I only modify the MPU9250 library Based on work KrisWiner on Github.
His original work can be found on GitHub. In my version, mostly a conversion to make it follow on keil uVision using HAL driver.
